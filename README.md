# CoffeeBean Text Editor
A simple text editor coded in Java. It's open-source and easily modifiable. The code can be used by whoever would like to use it.

The point of this is to provide an easy-to-understand jumping-off point for Java coders, and to hopefully be better than Notepad for Windows.

## Requirements:
- Java 14 or later
